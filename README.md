# STOCK PREDICTION USING LSTM
This project aims at predicting whether the company's stock prices will fall or rise by using the Long -Short Term Memory[LSTM] which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network[RNN]
Project Steps:
1) Import necessary libraries
2) Load the data
3) Preprocess the data
4) Build the LSTM model
5) Train the model
6) Evaluate the model
7) Make predictions
Project Resources:
The dataset used here is the Stock Prices of the company Netflix. I acquired this dataset from kaggle.
The IDE used is Jupyter Notebook as instructed to us in the task briefing

   By using machine learning techniques a company can forecast whether the stock prices will experience a decline or an increase. This information can be used by them to make more mindful decisions in the future.
